# Install Tailwind CSS with React, Vite and Typescript.

## 1 - Create your Project

Start by creating a new Vite project if you donâ€™t have one set up already.
I personally use the command `npm create vite@latest` and just follow the steps to create a React project with Typescript

```
npm run dev
```
